# The Pitch

Sup ! Everyone </br>
I'm (Gamedemons), a software/web developer. I started learning programming in my school days by making mini-games like crossword or tic tac toe. Later I started developing a few tools to help me with a few small tasks. I'm trying out many things to find what works for me(the most fun). Every project that you will find will be only for my learning. I hope you find my projects fulfilling.
